          Sapporo, the capital of Japan’s northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido,
          is known as the birthplace of miso-style ramen. Miso ramen is so
          popular among locals, in fact, that the city has not one but two ramen
          “alleys”: Ganso Ramen Yokocho and Shin Ramen Yokocho. To make this
          local specialty, fragrant soybean paste is sauteed together with
          ginger and garlic and mixed together with pork broth for a hearty bowl
          of ramen that hits the spot on even the coldest winter days. Toppings
          include roasted chashu pork, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts. You can
          also request to add corn and a creamy pat of butter, two local
          Hokkaido specialty products.

          Tonkotsu ramen from Hakata (modern-day Fukuoka) is a unique style of
          ramen made from pork bones boiled at a high temperature until they
          release their collagen, creating a rich and milky broth that’s cut
          with seafood stock. The ramen is served with thin straight noodles
          cooked to just under al dente and topped with thick slices of roasted
          pork, garlic, sesame seeds, and pickled ginger. If you finish the
          noodles quickly, it’s common practice to order a second helping,
          called kaedama. Although tonkotsu ramen originated in Kyushu, it has
          spread all throughout Japan and to many countries around the world.

          Known for its hand-cut noodles, the Kitakata area of northern Fukuoka
          specializes in ramen made with fat, wavy egg noodles. It’s served in a
          shoyu (soy sauce) based soup together with simple toppings: a few
          pieces of chashu pork, bamboo shoots, and a piece of naruto, a fish
          cake with a spiral of pink and white color. Although the ingredients
          may seem fairly basic, a bowl of Kitakata ramen fits many Japanese
          people’s quintessential image of what ramen looks like.

          In Wakayama prefecture, it’s common practice among the locals to ask
          for chuka soba, or “Chinese-style noodles”, rather than ramen. You’ll
          get a bowl of tonkotsu-shoyu ramen that blends together the pork bone
          broth popular in western Japan and the soy sauce-based ramen broth
          popular in eastern Japan. The noodles are thin and stick straight,
          similar to Hakata ramen, and topped with a generous helping of
          scallions as well as a slice of the pink-and-white naruto fish cake
          that usually comes with shoyu ramen. It’s also common to have your
          ramen here with a side of haya-zushi, a traditional Kansai-style
          pressed sushi made with pickled mackerel.

          Onomichi is a seaside town in Hiroshima prefecture located on the Seto
          Inland Sea, so it should come as no surprise that their regional style
          of ramen is made with fresh local seafood. The shoyu-based broth also
          contains chicken and a bit of pork, but the real star of the show is
          the layer of rich pork back fat suspended on top, giving it a punch of
          flavor. Hundreds of people a day feverishly line up at the town’s
          numerous ramen shops for a taste of Onomichi ramen.

          Despite its name, “Taiwan ramen,” Nagoya’s local style of ramen isn’t
          a direct import from Taiwan, although it is inspired by Taiwanese
          cooking. It’s named for the Taiwanese chef who invented the dish based
          on Taiwanese danzai noodles. Taiwan ramen features ramen noodles in a
          shoyu broth topped with spicy ground pork and nira (garlic chives).
          The dish pre-dates the spicy food trend in Japan, but its popularity
          has held strong and fast over the decades!

          Okinawa, the chain of islands off the southwestern tip of Japan, was
          once an independent archipelago separate from the rest of Japan known
          as the Ryuku Kingdom. Ryuku had its own distinctive language, culture,
          and food, including its own style of ramen referred to as “Okinawa
          soba”. The noodles themselves, while called “soba”, are actually more
          similar to udon flour noodles but are served in a ramen-style broth
          made with pork, bonito fish flakes, and kelp. Okinawa soba also uses
          unique toppings compared to other styles of ramen, including bone-in
          pork rib and pig trotters.

          Hakodate, a port city in Hokkaido, is considered the home of shio, or
          salt-based, ramen. The clear soup broth is made with chicken, pork,
          seafood, and kelp served with straight noodles cooked until tender.
          Although shio ramen is no saltier than shoyu ramen, it has a slightly
          different flavor profile to shoyu ramen with a cleaner, lighter taste
          that allows the chicken, pork, and seafood flavors to come through.

          Kurume ramen is the original style of Kyushu ramen that predates even
          the highly popular Hakata tonkotsu ramen. Ramen from the Kurume City
          area also uses a tonkotsu pork bone broth, but one that’s even richer
          and heavier than Hakata ramen with an even stronger pork aroma.

          Kagoshima is the only place in Kyushu that wasn’t influenced by Kurume
          City’s heavy tonkotsu ramen. Instead, the ramen here uses a blended
          broth of pork, chicken, dried sardines, vegetables, and dried shiitake
          mushrooms topped with scorched scallions. The cloudy soup has a mild
          flavor that is quite distinctive from other Kyushu-area ramens.
