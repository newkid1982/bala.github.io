        <h1>Etymology</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          The word ramen is a Japanese transcription of the Chinese lamian
          (拉麵). In 1910, the first ramen shop named Rairaiken (来々軒) opened
          at Asakusa, Tokyo, where the Japanese owner employed 12 Cantonese
          cooks from Yokohama's Chinatown and served the ramen arranged for
          Japanese customers.

        <h1>Origin</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodles. One theory
          says that ramen was introduced to Japan during the 1660s by the
          Chinese neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui who served as an advisor to
          Tokugawa Mitsukuni

        <h1>Postwar popularization</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          After Japan's defeat in World War II, the American military occupied
          the country from 1945 to 1952. In December 1945, Japan recorded its
          worst rice harvest in 42 years, which caused food shortages as Japan
          had drastically reduced rice production during the war as production
          shifted to colonies in China and Taiwan.

        <h1>Modern period</h1>
        <p>
          In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the
          Taiwanese-Japanese founder and chairman of Nissin Foods. Named the
          greatest Japanese invention of the 20th century in a Japanese
          poll,[20] instant ramen allowed anyone to make an approximation of
          this dish simply by adding boiling water.

          While ramen noodles are considered a complete one-pot meal if you have
          enough ramen per person,<br />
          there’s no rule against having some delicious side dishes too .

          In honor of National Noodle Day on Oct. 6, which you should celebrate
          by eating a ton of noodles and declaring your undying love for them,
          we’re here to help boost up the sentimentality factor and throw in
          some booze as well. Here are some great, if often unexpected, pairings
          for a few different kinds of noodles:
